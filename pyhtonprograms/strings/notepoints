Note: All string methods returns new values. They do not change the original string.

lengthvalue=len(data)-1  #length always start from one but index start from o but we are acess thought the index so we remove one value

A="lokesh" -->string
Strings acts like array when we want to acess elements by using index values (like each and every alphabet)
eg= A.[0]
Concatenating strings (+,*)
a = "Hello"
b = "World"
c = a + " " + b  # Concatenating strings

# Accessing the variables directly
print(a)  # Output: Hello
print(b)  # Output: World
print(c)  # Output: Hello World

# Using variables inside a string (f-string) on that time we use curly braces
e = f"jegini {b}"  # Note the f before the string when we use curly braces we did not use plus(+)symbol
print(e)  # Output: jegini World

e = "jegini" + b  # Removed curly braces around 'b'
print(e)
combination 
1)adding variables c = a+ b 
2)varibe and sting seperately e = "jegini" + b
3)variable inside string f"jegini {b}" -->when we use curly braces we did not use plus(+)symbol

in slice operator place i am confusion
-------------------------------------
print(b[2:6]) end-1 (up to 5 it will print here index is zero)
				 
				 start, start + 2 -->start means current index position (from the above example) 2 is the index value
				 
				 --------
				 end value always (n-1)			 
				 end value will not include with the stepvalue claculation
				 start vlaue only include with the the stepvalue claculation
				 end value is used for check the range (for priting in between the vlaues)

Inbuild function vs In build method-total 46 to 50 methods are present
---------------------------------
print()#inbuild function
data.count()

inbuild properties and mehods (properties are like a variables )
-----------------------------for each and every data type we have inbuild methods (now we are learning how to use inbild methods)
1)some methods take the aruguemnts
2)some are not taking-->when we hover on the method it will show if it accept the aruguments
3)if take how many aruguments it will take -->vs studion suggest arugument how may required seperated with comma operator and data type alos in the object format
4)how many are required how many are optional ,-->difference between optional vs required-->if they are optional what is the default vzlue for that optional
5)uses of each arugument
6)data type of each arugument
7)after execute the the method what is the output.
8)aruguments difference between required and optional --> aruguments required vs optional for required blue color will show for optional light color will show when we hover on the method name
9)find difference between user define and the optiona properties and methods-->for the inbuild method or functions description will show for the user define description will not show
10)final output value data type -->if we hover on the propert ot method name we will see at the end of the method
----------------
learning type
1)method belong to which data type
2)definition of method (here described uses of particular function)
3)syntax i writn above
4)how we track every details through vsstudio
---------------------note point for the dots--------------
1)why we are using the dot symbol -->for acess the property and values
2)singledot --> data="lokesh" -->data.index() -->here data hold same value and  based on the value of data type we use propery and method
3)moredots --> object eg:details={name:"lokesh"} -->details.name.lokesh (details is object from this object we are acess name property this value is string so we call again sting property )
note :- if we use more dots also not a problem because same concept
a)dot is used to acess the properties names and methods.
b)where we are using dot each and everything act as one variable,we are calling properties and methods by using dot each variable hold somevalue.
c) details.name.lokesh-->when we are using dotd final output value is filtering (here lokesh variavle value is the final output)
