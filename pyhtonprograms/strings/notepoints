< -- this symbol is used when we move from left to right direction on array or string data type
> -- this symbol is used when we move from rigth to left direction on array or string data type
lengthvalue=len(data)-1  #length always start from one but index start from o but we are acess thought the index so we remove one value
return key word we used inthe block not only inthe functions

find --if no string it will return -1
index --if no string it will return error

for each and every data type we have inbuild functions (now we are learning how to use inbild function)
we have inbild function to eveydata type (we learn from a to z we allways pass aruguments to the the inbild functions)
how many arugument we want to send
what type we need to send wether number or srting or any other types (how we know esily)

method -- we call 
userd define function difference

concadination we use "lokesh"+{data}+"mahi" 
concadination easy methos print(f"a={}") {data}--we get value as output
a=10
b=20
c=30
print("a={a},b={b},c={c}".format(a,b,c)) 
print("a={2},b={1},c={3}.format(a,b,c)")

-----------------------------------------------------------
method
definition
syntax
Note: All string methods returns new values. They do not change the original string.
total 46 to 50 methods are present
#staring datatype
data=lokesh
Inbuild function vs In build method
---------------------------------
print()#inbuild function
data.count()

below thing desctibed about syntax
---------------------
string.count(value, start, end)

1)some methods take the aruguemnts
2)some are not taking
3)if take how many aruguments it will take
4)how many are required how many are optional ,if they are optional what is the default vzlue for that optional
5)uses of each arugument
6)data type of each arugument
7)after execute the the method what is the output.
----------------
learning type
1)method belong to which data type
2)definition of method (here described uses of particular function)
3)syntax i writn above
4)how we track every details through vsstudio


---------------
vs studion suggest arugument how may required seperated with comma operator and data type alos in the object format
in vs studio method symbol is Y rambos symbol
--------------
difference between optional vs required
print(a.isidentifier()) dot to dot we are filtring the values it move left to right forward direction
if the method is start with  is that is checking condition
x = txt.rfind("casa") single alpha or word
-----------------
my self i understan wrong and i confused 
txt = "banana" (only we are moving positive direction) her we did not move any negative direction

x = txt.rjust(20, "O")
----------------
rjust(20, "O")when it come to right i am ubderstaning in the reverse direction getting confusion
ljust() i am confusion -->l means always we are reading in the one direction left to right
--------------------
txt = ".....banana,,,,,ssqqqww....."

x = txt.rstrip(",.qsw")

print(x)
--------------
difference between 1)strip both directions
2)lstrip left to right
3)rstrip right to left

note index position alway positive (for or is hight)
for l is small first occurance
