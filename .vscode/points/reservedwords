in pyhton evey line is written in the samll letters (except True,False,None)
each and evey programing have reserved words are present
True,False,None -->(entire pyhton constructed with this 33 reserved words)
learning python is understad all this keywords (in js we use null in python we use None)
n python reserved words and inbuid functions are different
resrved words:- if, else, for, while, def, class, import, return, True, False, None, and others.
predefine functions:print(), len(), input(), range(), abs(), sum(), max(), min(), type(),
Reserved words are used to create new structure (this are used to constructour own logic)
predefine functions are used to just call particular predefine function and use in our programing language.
      for predefine function allready structure created by the python language developer 
	  
------------how to find difference between predefine function and keyword----------
1)predefine function is represet with pranthities eg:print()
2)key words did not consit any paranthities
--------------------
